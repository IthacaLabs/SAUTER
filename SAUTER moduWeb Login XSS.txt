Reflected XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) attack
-------------------------------------------

Type: Unauthenticated Remote attack

We have identified that the “Sauter moduWeb - Login” web page of “SAUTER moduWeb” product is vulnerable to Reflective Cross-site scripting (XSS). This is due to that the Web App fails to adequately sanitize request strings of malicious JavaScript. By leveraging this issue, an attacker is able to cause arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code to be executed in a user's browser within the security context of the affected site. This attack can be used in conjunction with a social engineering techniques.

The injection point is in the "locale" HTTP POST parameter, which is a hidden parameter in the HTML Login Form. We have managed to exploit this issue by crafting the "locale" parameter in the URL path (as an HTTP GET parameter) and inserting the XSS payload as value.


Below, evidence is provided.

Payload in URL:
http://IP/?locale=something"/> <script>alert("XSS by IthacaLabs")</script> <input type="hidden" name="locale2" value="something2

Affected Code:
<input type="hidden" name="locale" value= "something"/> <script>alert("XSS by IthacaLabs")</script> <input type="hidden" name="locale2" value="something2">
