We have identified that the Logo File Upload functionality ("POST /settings/display" endpoint) is vulnerable to a persistent DOS (Denial Of Service) attack. We have managed to successfully upload a malicious .jpg image since there is no any image size validation, then the web app parsed the malicious image and froze (crashed).

Every time a user successfully logs into the "SAUTER moduWeb" web interface/login portal, the web app itself automatically retrieves the malicious "logo.jpg" image file by requesting the "GET /target-domain/customizing/logo.jpg" endpoint. Then, the web app tries to parse the malicious images and then it freezes. This would lead to a persistent DOS attack, until someone replace the "logo.jpg" with a valid one from the server-side.
