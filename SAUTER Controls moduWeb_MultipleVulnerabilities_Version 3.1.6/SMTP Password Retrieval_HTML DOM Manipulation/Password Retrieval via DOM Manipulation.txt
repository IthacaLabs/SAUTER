We have managed to acquire the SMTP password ("/settings/email" endpoint) that is protected/hidden behind asterisks (*) by manipulating the HTML DOM (by changing the "type" of "passwordmail" id from "password" to "text"). An attacker with access to the web interface, they could also access the SMTP Service using the credentials obtained and perform further attacks.

The "Inspect Element" should not be allowed.
