We have managed to acquire the SMTP password ("/settings/email" endpoint) that is protected/hidden with asterisks (*) since it can be transmitted in cleartext format over SSL. We have managed to acquire the password in cleartext by executing the button of the HTML Form ("/settings/email" endpoint) and intercepting the HTTP request using a Proxy tool. An attacker with access to the web interface, they could also access the SMTP Service using the credentials obtained and perform further attacks.
